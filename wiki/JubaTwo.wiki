#summary Documenting the start of juba two

= Introduction =

Juba will become a web programming library for small perl based
projects. The development focus is to implement a declarative 
style to describe a web application.

The another reason to have this project is the need of an environment
where my tiny code creations can breath and see the light of the outside.

= History =

Juba was a real three day project of mine to implement a tiny website 
editor. It was used for a course with kids to show them the way HTML
works.

= Details =
