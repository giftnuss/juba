= Juba is written in Perl =

You see a lot of totally wired (crazy) code, so which language is better to write this?

= No this is not a serious project? =

At this moment really not. It is far away from being usable so it can't be serious. But I 
use a test driven approach, which proves that that the wiredness works. If there are 10*10*10 working tests this project becomes serious. The first ten is not reached now...
