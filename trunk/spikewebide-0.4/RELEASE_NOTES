                        Spike Web IDE Release Notes
                        ===========================

 * TODO

  -  At the moment, Web IDE can only do single flush command line executions. If some repetitive
process requires several separate commands, a plugin will be impossible. To modify for this,
some sort of looping would be required when searching for 'execution.value' tags.
  - change 'Add New Tool' to 'Upload New Tool' w/ browse interface
  * Validity Checks on Corresponding conf Tags
  - caching implementation on generated forms
  - META tags on individual tools themselves
  - certification - individual tools & collection


Version 0.4
-----------

This is the very first release of Web IDE. It is an alpha release.
