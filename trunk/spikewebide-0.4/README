##############################

This Web IDE is a very basic tool that allows a user to manipulate any sort of application,
so long as it may be invoked through command line and it outputs (preferrably html) to
a specified directory.

This will benefit anyone wishing to bypass a lot of repetitive command line typing.
Suppose you are developing a PHP application, and you use PHPCheckstyle, PHP Security
Audit, and PHP Code Coverage to continually refresh output regarding your application.
You could plugin these tools with the information you need, ultimately reducing your 
pains to the click of an execute button.

The IDE simply uses .conf files from the conf/ directory to concatentate together an 
executable shell command string. See conf/Conf_Directions for more information. These
.conf files will define how to do the background execution, as well as optionally
determining how to present the same information on the generated HTML form.

Prerequisites:

You can choose either the built-in Python server or the PHP scripts as back end.

  * For Python server: Python 2.4+
  * For PHP: PHP 5+ with Apache 2

Execution: 

  * Apache 2 with PHP 5+ module:

      1. Place entire Web IDE folder somewhere within the Apache document root.
         Navigate to the folder through a browser. The Apache configuration should
         be set to automatically load index.html.

  * Python Server:
 
      1. Invoke the lightweight server:
  
          > python ideserver.py

      2. Bring up a browser and enter the following as the url:
   
          http://localhost:8888/
