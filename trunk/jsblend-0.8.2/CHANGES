JSBlend 0.8.2
=============

* The biggest enhancement in this version is the ability to edit both files at the same time.
* Optionally, either of the files can be treated as the merge target.
* Several bugs with remote file access are fixed. 
* Calling the jsblend.py command now automatically connects to a running server or starts the server if none is running.
  Thus now it is a one-step process to start editing the diffs.
