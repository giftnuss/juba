Prerequisites:
  
You can choose the built-in Python server as a backend. The PHP scripts that shipped
with earlier versions of JSBlend are deprecated, not maintained, and do not support 
many features. They will removed in future releases.

  * For Python server: Python 2.4+
  * GNU Diffutils 2.8.7 or newer
    * Should be available on all Linux installations by default
    * For Windows, get the Windows native binaries for GNU Diffutils from 
      http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm
      Make sure that diff.exe is in PATH.
  * Remote file support
    * On Linux, SCP is supported by using pexpect (http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/).
      Relevant files are already included in this release. No further installation is needed.
    * For using remote file editing over SCP on Windows, please install
      WinSCP from http://winscp.net/eng/index.php. Make sure WinSCP.exe and 
      WinSCP.com are in PATH.
    * HTTP and HTTPS are supported using Python urllib2 module. No special installation is
      needed on either of the platforms.
  * You may want to run the python server over SSL. For this, you will have to install 
    pyOpenSSL (http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/). If the server does not find this module
    it will startup in a non-secure HTTP mode and listen on port 8888. In secure mode, the 
    server listens on port 8443.
    A provisional certificate is included in the ssl/server.pem file. You may decide to use
    your own certificate by replace this file.
    If you are using password authentication over scp for remote files, secure mode is strongly
    recommended.
  * Browsers
    * Firefox 2 or newer is preferred. (http://www.getfirefox.com)
    * IE 7 or newer (works okay - may not be as pretty).

Installation:

  * Linux:
    
    1. Untar the tarball in a directory of your choice.
         cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs
         tar -xzf jsblend-<ver>.tar.gz

    2. Start the python server. [Optional]
         cd jsblend-<ver>
         python diffserver.py

    3. Access viewdiff.html from your browser
         firefox "https://localhost:8443/viewdiff.html" OR
         firefox "http://localhost:8888/viewdiff.html"

       OR
       Invoke the command line interface for JSBlend:
         python jsblend.py <left-file> <right-file> [-b <browser-executable] [-r] [-s <server-url>]
       This command will also start the server if it not running.

    4. Sample files for diff/merge are located under "samples" directory.
       Enter the paths for files "httpd.conf" and "httpd.conf.new"
       in the 'Left' and 'Right' text boxes and click on [Get Diff].

    5. If the server is running in a separate window, press CTRL-C to stop it.
       If it was started by jsblend.py command, find the PID of python process that is
       running 'diffserver.py' and kill it. The server output will appear in output.log.
        
  * Windows:

    Follow the same steps as above, except use appropriate paths.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

  * On Linux, Password authentication is supported for accessing remote files over scp. We use the
    python pexpect module (http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/) for this. If you have trouble accessing
    remote files, it might be because your 'ssh' and 'scp' commands might be using different prompts 
    than found on most Linux distributions. In such cases, you should set up password-less access over ssh.
    (See below.)

  * On Windows, password authentication is not supported since pexpect does not work natively on Windows.
    You may be able to use it with Cygwin. In that case, just follow Linux instructions. If you want to use
    remote file support over scp on Windows, make sure you setup password-less access over ssh using 
    PuTTY and WinSCP. (See below)

  * Password-less SSH:
    * For remote file support over scp, you may have to set up password-less ssh/scp access 
      from the machine running JSBlend server to the remote machine. This is usually done using 
      public-private key authentication. 

    * On Windows, you should use puttygen.exe that comes with WinSCP to generate a public/private key
      pair. The public key should be copied to your remote machine in the appropriate directory. Then
      the PuTTY Authentication Agent (pagent.exe) should be started and the private key added to the daemon.
      See "http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter8.html" for more information.

      WARNING: WinSCP also allows specifying password in the connection url by using the format 
               'scp://user:password@host:/path'. This is very insecure and should NOT be used. 
               Password specified like this will be visible in the Web Browser. 

    * On Linux, generate a key pair using 'ssh-keygen -t dsa'. Copy the private key as ~/.ssh/id_dsa. The 
      public key should be added to the remote machines ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
